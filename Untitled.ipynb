    "4) Strikers are the poster boys of any team and they leave  the dirty business of tackeling to their team mates. 1.2 per game\n",

Lets assume 1 of a difference either side of the averages mentioned for defenders and midfielders,.7 of a difference for strikers and .1 of a defference for goalkeepers. "
